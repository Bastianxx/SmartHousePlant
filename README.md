# Portal Smart self watering house plants is not just a good idea but should be a practice in the future. We can use technology to better our health and mental state. All while going green. What we have developed is our first version of the self watering houseplant. We are launching it as one of our first products. We are looking to see how consumers take the idea. We think anyone that stays home will enjoy it.
Some of the cool features include measuring data from reading the environment for temperature, humidity, pressure, moister, air, and dust quality.  This allows us to see the conditions for the plant and for ourselves. From the moisture detection it will activate the water pump to water the plant if the soil gets too dry. It will do this with a half second of push of water through the pump tube that the moisture sits in below the plant. Readings happen every 30 minutes to check on environmental conditions which then is published to an online dashboard but some data as well can be seen on a OLED monitor attached to the plant.
There are many bonuses to this kind of connectivity. The combination of the plant and the sensors gives us a better chance of staying healthy and living in a more eco friendly environment.
